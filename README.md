# FinewayGist
Gist for the coding challenge for Fineway.

Finished the challenge about 30 seconds after the 15 minutes was up. However, the output is not perfect because the split() function only separates words according to spaces, so it does not take into account the capitals and punctuation.

Here's what I would do to run it in producction:
-Obviously test for errors and think of any possible situation where the code might fail. Then proceed to fix those errors.
-As I mentioned to Sebastian I am much more familiar with Ruby on Rails (I have only used Python as a data scientist) so I would implement this module in my rails app using the gem pycall which enables you to import python modules into rails. In case of implementing this using node.js backend I would set up automatic test for debuging.
-Comment everything that was done in the Python module and make it as understandable and as easy to read as possible.


Would love to join the Fineway team.

Thanks
Cristian
